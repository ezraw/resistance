# TODO

## UI Polish

- [x] **Typography**: Use Font Awesome caret-up/down for arrows, SF Rounded Bold for numbers
- [x] **Center box color**: Make it percentage transparent of background color instead of white/dark switch
- [ ] **Ripple wave animation**: Background color change should ripple in direction of up/down

## UX Improvements

- [x] **Tap responsiveness**: Improve responsiveness for quick tap-tap-tap, haptic feedback keeping up

## Bug Fixes

- [x] **Long-tap scope**: Disconnect dialog triggers on long-tap anywhere - should only trigger on the connected indicator
- [ ] **Crash on long-tap**: Long-tapping the green connected indicator crashed the app (not reproducible now - monitor)

## Distribution

- [ ] **Apple Developer Account**: Sign up for paid account ($99/year)
- [ ] **TestFlight setup**: Configure app for TestFlight distribution
- [ ] **Invite testers**: Add wife's email to TestFlight beta testers
