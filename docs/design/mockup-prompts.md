# UI Redesign — Image Generation Prompts

Use these prompts in ChatGPT (DALL-E), Midjourney, or similar AI image tools
to generate concept mockups for the Resistance app redesign.

**Design direction:** Kidcore / Y2K pixel-art arcade aesthetic. Hot pink to deep
purple dithered gradient backgrounds with scattered pixel particles. Dark purple
center panels with magenta/pink rounded borders. Yellow/gold chunky pixel-art
arrows and buttons with 3D depth. Cyan diagonal speed-streak accents. Pixel-art
heart icon for heart rate. Bordered HUD-style badges. The overall vibe is a
retro arcade game screen — vibrant, bold, and playful.

## Prompt 1: Main Resistance Control Screen (Idle State)

```
Mobile app UI mockup on an iPhone screen, portrait orientation. A bike trainer
resistance control app with a retro pixel-art arcade game aesthetic.

The background is a hot pink gradient at the top fading to deep purple at the
bottom, with a pixel dither/noise texture throughout. Diagonal cyan and pink
speed-streak lines cut across the upper portion of the background. Small
scattered pixel particles float across the purple areas like confetti.

In the center is a large dark purple panel with rounded corners and a bright
magenta/hot-pink border. Inside the panel: a chunky yellow/gold pixel-art
up-arrow with orange 3D shadow depth at the top, a huge white "45" in the
middle, and a matching yellow/gold pixel-art down-arrow at the bottom. Above
the up arrow, a small yellow-bordered badge reads "+5" indicating the
increment amount. Faint horizontal divider lines separate the arrows from
the number.

At the top-left is a "CONNECTED" badge — a purple bordered rectangle with a
green glowing dot and pixel-style text. At the top-right is a pixel-art red
heart icon containing "152" in white (heart rate display).

At the bottom center is a chunky yellow/gold "START" button with a dark
border, a play-triangle icon on the left, and bold text. The button has
3D depth with a darker bottom edge.

Retro pixel-art arcade game aesthetic, 16-bit era inspired, vibrant kidcore
color palette: hot pinks, magentas, deep purples, cyans, and yellow/gold
accents. The feel is like a colorful retro game HUD for a fitness app.

top fading through magenta to deep purple at the bottom, with pixel dither
texture. Diagonal cyan and yellow speed-streak lines across the upper area,
more intense than idle state. Scattered pixel particles throughout.

The same dark purple center panel with magenta border contains chunky
yellow/gold pixel-art up/down arrows and a large white "70" in the middle.
The "+5" increment badge sits above the up arrow.

At the top is a game-style HUD bar: on the left, a timer badge showing a
pixel clock icon and "12:34" in white text inside a dark purple bordered
rectangle. On the right, the pixel-art red heart icon now shows "142"
(active heart rate). Between them, a small amber/yellow warning triangle
pixel icon (connection degraded indicator).

At the bottom center is a chunky "PAUSE" button — same style as START but
in a magenta-to-purple gradient with a pixel pause icon (two vertical bars).
Dark border with 3D depth.

The overall feel is more intense and energetic — like a game level heating
up. Same pixel-art arcade aesthetic with hot pinks, oranges, magentas,
purples, cyans, and yellow accents.

## Prompt 3: Paused Workout State (Multiple Buttons)

```
Mobile app UI mockup on an iPhone screen, portrait orientation. A bike trainer
resistance control app with a retro pixel-art arcade game aesthetic, shown
in a paused workout state.

The background is a cooler lavender-to-deep-purple gradient with pixel dither
texture, suggesting a calmer pause moment. Subtle cyan speed-streaks are
still visible but more subdued. Scattered pixel particles throughout.

The dark purple center panel with magenta border shows "35" large and white,
with the yellow/gold pixel-art up/down arrows and "+5" badge.

At the top, the HUD bar shows the timer "08:22" on the left in a bordered
badge and the pixel heart with "118" on the right.

At the bottom are THREE chunky pixel-art arcade buttons in a horizontal row:
"RESUME" (largest, bright green/cyan gradient, play-triangle icon, dark
border with 3D depth), "RESTART" (medium, yellow/orange gradient, circular
arrow icon), and "FINISH" (medium, red/magenta gradient, stop-square icon).
Each button has the same chunky bordered style with darker bottom edges
creating 3D depth, like arcade cabinet buttons.

The feel is like a game pause menu — still vibrant but momentarily calm.
Pixel-art arcade aesthetic with lavenders, purples, magentas, cyan, yellow,
and green/red accents on the buttons.

## Prompt 4: Low Resistance State (Cool Colors)

```
Mobile app UI mockup on an iPhone screen, portrait orientation. A bike trainer
resistance control app with a retro pixel-art arcade game aesthetic, at low
resistance level.

The background is a cool cyan-to-teal at the top fading to deep purple at
the bottom, with pixel dither texture. Diagonal speed-streak lines in mint
and pink across the upper area. Scattered pixel particles in the purple
sections.

The dark purple center panel with a teal/cyan border (instead of magenta,
reflecting the cooler resistance level) shows a large white "10" with the
yellow/gold pixel-art up/down arrows and "+5" badge.

The "CONNECTED" badge at top-left and pixel heart at top-right remain in
their standard positions.

At the bottom is the chunky yellow/gold "START" button with play-triangle
icon and dark bordered 3D depth.

The overall tone is cool, inviting, and relaxed — like the opening level of
an arcade game before the intensity ramps up. Same pixel-art arcade aesthetic
but with a cooler color temperature: cyans, teals, mints, purples, with
yellow and pink accents.

## Prompt 5: Workout Summary / History Screen (Future)

```
Mobile app UI mockup on an iPhone screen, portrait orientation. A workout
summary screen for a bike trainer app with a retro pixel-art arcade game
aesthetic.

The background is a deep purple-to-magenta gradient with pixel dither texture
and scattered pixel particles. At the top, "WORKOUT COMPLETE" in bold white
text with small pixel sparkle/star decorations around it, like a retro game
victory screen. Subtle cyan speed-streaks in the background.

Below the heading is a large dark purple panel with magenta border (matching
the main screen style) containing workout stats in a grid layout: Duration
"24:30", Avg Resistance "55%", Max Heart Rate "156 bpm", Calories "320 kcal".
Each stat has a small pixel-art icon in yellow or cyan, and the numbers are
bold and large in white. Faint divider lines separate the stat sections.

Below the stats panel is a "WORKOUT HISTORY" section with 2-3 smaller dark
purple cards with magenta borders, each showing: a date, duration, and a
small horizontal pixel-art progress bar in gradient colors (cyan to pink)
indicating average intensity.

At the bottom is a chunky yellow/gold "DONE" button in the same arcade
button style with play-triangle icon, dark border, and 3D depth.

The feel is celebratory and rewarding — like a retro game high-score screen.

The background is a dark indigo-to-deep-purple gradient with pixel dither
texture and scattered pixel particles. Subtle grid lines in a slightly
lighter purple, reminiscent of a retro game radar screen.

At the top, "SEARCHING..." in bold white text with a pixel-art Bluetooth
icon in cyan that appears to pulse/glow. Small pixel sparkle decorations
around the text.

In the center is a pixel-art radar/scan visualization — concentric circles
or rings in magenta and cyan pulsing outward, inside a dark purple bordered
panel. The circles have a retro scanline feel.

Below the radar, discovered devices appear as dark purple cards with magenta
borders (matching the main screen panel style). One card reads "KICKR TRAINER"
in white with a pixel-art signal-strength icon in green/cyan. The card looks
tappable with subtle 3D depth and a brighter border highlight.

At the bottom, smaller text reads "Tap a trainer to connect" in a lighter
purple/lavender color.

The feel is like a retro game lobby or character select screen — anticipation
before the action. Same pixel-art arcade aesthetic: deep indigos, purples,
magentas, cyans, and yellow accents.

## Prompt 7: Max Resistance State (Intense)

```
Mobile app UI mockup on an iPhone screen, portrait orientation. A bike trainer
resistance control app with a retro pixel-art arcade game aesthetic, at
maximum resistance level 100.

The background is an intense deep red-to-dark-purple gradient with heavy pixel
dither texture. Diagonal speed-streak lines in hot orange and yellow, more
numerous and intense than other states. Pixel particles are more dense and
fiery-colored. The whole screen radiates intensity.

The dark purple center panel has a bright red/orange border (reflecting max
intensity). A large white "100" fills the number area. The yellow/gold
pixel-art up arrow is dimmed/grayed out (maxed). The down arrow remains
bright yellow. The "+5" badge above the up arrow is also dimmed.

The "CONNECTED" badge at top-left and pixel heart showing a high HR "168"
at top-right.

At the bottom is a chunky "PAUSE" button in red/orange gradient with pixel
pause icon, matching the intense vibe.
